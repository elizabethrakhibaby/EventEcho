           Project Description
========================================
This event management system enables seamless interaction between event 
organizers and attendees, utilizing an MVC pattern. Java EE powers the backend, 
while JSF and PrimeFaces deliver a dynamic, user-friendly interface. 
JSF managed beans ensure smooth data handling and user input processing.

In a subsequent redevelopment, RESTful APIs were introduced to connect a new 
React frontend with the existing Java EE backend, showcasing full-stack 
development skills and effective integration techniques.
